
Doing releases:

ag-Grid

+ Update version in bower.json
+ Update version in package.json
+ Run 'gulp release'
+ Make sure any new files in 'dist' are added to Git
+ Commit all changes to Github (including built files in /dist)
+ Release in Github
+ Push to by running 'npm publish ./'

Now if a new major version, go update and release:
ag-grid-enterprise, ag-grid-react, ag-grid-ng2, ag-grid-react-example, ag-grid-ng2-example, ag-grid-commonjs-example

ag-Grid-Enterprise

+ Update version in bower.json
+ Update version in package.json
+ Make sure correct ag-grid is in node_modules (it's a peer dependency, so wont get installed with npm install)
+ Run 'gulp release'
+ Make sure any new files in 'dist' are added to Git
+ Commit all changes to Github (including built files in /dist)
+ Release in Github
+ Push to by running 'npm publish ./'

ag-Grid-Docs

+ Update version in package.json
+ Commit to Github (do NOT include built files in /dist)
+ Run 'gulp release'
