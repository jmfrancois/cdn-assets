# CDN assets

This repository is the result of the build of many opensource libraries.
It is the content for a POC around our approach of CDN.

So it contains only opensource libraries.

They are automaticly exposed in gh-pages. For example:

https://jmfrancois.github.io/cdn-assets/dist/react/16.8.0/umd/react.production.min.js
